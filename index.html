			<h2>Local News: Coronavirus pandemic forces the funeral industry online</h2>
			<br>
    		<p>If you know someone who’s had to plan a funeral during the Covid-19 shutdown, you realize how much tougher it is to go through this already difficult task.
				<br>
				Most states have limited gatherings to no more than 10 people. Planning and pricing a funeral online is a service the industry has not usually provided.
				<br>
				“The funeral industry is very much steeped in tradition,” said Chris Cruger, chief operating officer at The Foresight Companies, a consulting firm for the industry.
